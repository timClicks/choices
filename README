choices : for making random decisions

choices allows you to simulate decision making from a
probability distribution. more formally, it provides
a declarative mechanism for introducing stochastic
behaviour to your code.

    >>> from choices import PDist
    >>> mood = PDist({'happy': 0.3, 'sad': 0.1, 'neutral': 0.6})
    >>> mood()
    'happy'
    >>> mood()
    'neutral'
