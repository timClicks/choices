choices.Choice is designed to make it easy to make it easy to 
make things happen in a probablistic manner. Provide keys with 
an associated probability attached, and the

    >>> mood = Choice({'happy': 0.3, 'neutral': 0.6, 'sad': 0.1})
    >>> mood()
    'happy'
    >>> mood()
    'neutral'

You can retrieve the distribution of how those values are applied
by accessing the distribution attribute:

    >>> mood.distribution
    [('happy', 0.3), ('neutral', 0.6), ('sad', 0.1)]

As well as a dict assigning a probability to each key, you can
send in a list of lists/tuples. This allows for for non-hashable
types to be used. This means that you provide objects such as 
functions to be used as keys:

  >>> def grumpy(news):
  ...    return ':/'
  >>> def happy(news):
  ...    return ':)'
  >>> react = Choice([(grumpy, 0.7), (happy, 0.3)])
  >>> reaction = react()
  >>> reaction("We're getting married!")
  ':/'

You are not restricted to adding p to 1. If you only have samples,
and wish to calculate a probablilty distribution, you can provide 
those too:

   >>> spotted = {'geese': 0, 'ducks': 12, 'sparrows': 4, 'other': 39}
   >>> birds = Choice(spotted)
   >>> birds.distribution
   [('geese', 0.0), ('sparrows', 0.07272727272727272), ('ducks', 0.21818181818181817), ('other', 0.7090909090909091)]

Retrieving the probability of a particular key is supported. However,
the search strategy is very inefficient and probably shouldn't be used
outside of the interactive Python shell.

    >>> birds['geese']
    0.0
